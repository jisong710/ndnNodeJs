 * AES-CTR encryption algorithm.

 * Initialization Vectors must be 16 octets.
 * During encryption, if IV is unspecified, it is constructed with two parts:
 * @li a 64-bit random number, generated each time a private key instance is constructed;
 * @li a 64-bit counter starting from zero.
 *
 * During decryption, quality of IV is not automatically checked.
 * Since the security of AES-CTR depends on having unique IVs, the application is recommended to
 * check IVs using CounterIvChecker type.
